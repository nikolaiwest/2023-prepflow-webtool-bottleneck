  default-title1: ðŸ”½ Data description
  default-text1: The sample data originates from a value stream with five workstations S and six buffers B. The value stream is directed and the system boundaries are unconstrained. The process time pt was set to 2.00, with stations S1 and S3 having additional process time of 2.25. The maximum capacity of buffers bc was set to 5 parts for all buffers. The data set comprises 10 million time steps and is fully available online.
  default-title2: ðŸ”½ Recommendations for usage 
  default-text2: The merit of this data set is that it can be applied quickly. Both the simulation and the use of own data are associated with longer calculation times, whereby the duration depends considerably on the selected parameters. Here, a model has already been pre-trained for the example data set, so the forecast can also be viewed quickly. A detailed description of this use case can be found in further detail in our publication on bottleneck forecasting, which serves as the basis for this web tool.
  simulation-title1: ðŸ”½ Details of the simulation
  simulation-text1: With the help of a simulation, a new data set can be generated and used in the bottleneck analysis. Thus, comparable use cases can be tested without the need for existing data. In addition to the simulation, the calculation of the active operating periods also takes place in this step. The process is associated with longer range times. 10,000 time steps at five stations require about 15 minutes of calculation time.
  simulation-title2: ðŸ”½ Customization of the parameters
  simulation-text2: In the following, all relevant parameters of the simulation can be defined. For further adjustments of the simulation we refer to our publication on bottleneck detection methods, which serves as a basis for the simulation.
  simulation-param1: Number of stations
  simulation-param2: Total simulation time
  simulation-param3: Specify process times (pt)
  simulation-param4: Specify buffer capacity (bc)
  upload-title1: ðŸ”½ Upload buffer level
  upload-text1: The buffer levels contain the time as index, as well as an attribute per available buffer. This attribute indicates how many parts are currently stored in the buffer. The maximum fill level must not be exceeded.  The following is an exemplary excerpt of the data set.
  upload-title2: ðŸ”½ Upload active periods
  upload-text2: The active operating periods contain information on the duration that the existing stations are active. There is a separate attribute for each station. In addition, the "bottleneck" attribute contains information about which station is currently active for the longest time. The following is an exemplary excerpt of the data set.
